                Dear Math teachers, Your students love you so much and appreciate you more
                than what words can express. Few students on behalf of everyone have
                decided to show their gratitude.

        ”Mathematics does not teach us to love more or hate less ,it teaches us
        that every problem has a solution.It isn’t just about computation
        operations,equations and numbers .It is about Logical thinking and
        reasoning .Thank you teachers for teaching us such an important subject
        with such great values!Happy teachers day!! ”

        Dear Math teachers,<br />Thank you for teaching each and everyone of us
        Math. William Paul Thurston once said “Mathematics is not about numbers,
        equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding”, at
        first, I didn’t really agree on this statement, but you have brought magic
        that made me understand and agree to this statement. Thank you for
        clearing my doubts, I now understand much more about it, and I really do
        appreciate it. Once again, thank you so much for everything you have done.
        </p>

            You taught us how to be good students, and those skills will help us in all our other classes in the future. Maths can be a tough subject for some students, but you still never give up and keep on motivating us. I know some of us may not use all the maths formulas in our lives but I am sure that the life lessons taught by you will certainly help us sail through.
